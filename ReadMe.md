This folder contains sample code to run the experiments reported in Figure 4.
To execute the example, run the script `main_aSyn_agg_model.m` in the MATLAB terminal.

Line 122 activates the simulation of the scenario: "Lipidic aggregation in isolation".
Line 640 activates the simulation of the scenario: "Pure and lipidic aggregation".

The folder contains:

`asyn_agg_model.m`: A function assigning the model parameters and implementing the mathematical equations of the model.

`main_aSyn_agg_model.m`: A function handling the simulation of the model.

`colormap.mat`: A MATLAB structure that contains the color palette.
